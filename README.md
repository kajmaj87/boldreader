# boldreader
Web reading extension for personal use

## Installation

Right now only temporary installation in firefox is supported.

Grab the lates release and then:

Go to `about:debugging` and click on `Firefox`. Click on `Load temporary add-on` and load the `*.xpi` file there.

## Usage

Currently the plugin will bolderize around 30% of each word (1 char at the minimum) and this will only happen in HTML Paragraphs that do not have any HTML tags inside them (pure text only).
